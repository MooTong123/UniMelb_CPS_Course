# UniMelb_CPS_Course

DISCIPLINE CORE:
There are four courses students must take.

Attention: 
Students who have taken any of these subjects or equivalent as part of their undergraduate studies are exempt from taking those subjects, and will be required to make up an equivalent number of subject points from the pool of Discipline Elective subjects. Students will normally take Research Methods in their second or third semester of enrolment, concurrent with or subsequent to the commencement of their Research Project.



DISCIPLINE ELECTIVES:
Students are required to select either 50 or 62.5 points of discipline elective subjects;
In other words, students should take 4 or 5 courses from 17 courses.

Attention:
Or additional non-project postgraduate subjects that complement students' research projects, where approved by the course coordinator.



PROFESSIONAL SKILLS:
Students must take 1 to 2 subjects from 9 courses.

Attention:
*Students who enrol in ENGR90021 Engineering Communication must take 12.5 pts only of Professional Skills subjects, and may not take SCIE90012 Science Communication.


RESEARCH PROJECT:
Students are required to undertake a 75 pt Research Project, normally to commence in the second semester of their course, in the research theme where they have focused their discipline elective subject selection. The Research Project will be carried out under the supervision of academics in the Department of Computing and Information Systems. Students will gain research experience in Computer Science by completing a thesis of approximately 25,000 words (contributing 90% of the grade for the Research Project subject) and giving an oral presentation of their project work prior to submission of the thesis (contributing the remaining 10% of the Research Project grade). The thesis will be examined internally within the Department of Computing and Information Systems.

The research project will be taken over three consecutive semesters and will begin on the Monday of the second semester of enrolment (semester 1 or 2) and continue until the end of the final semester of research project enrolment. The research project work continues over summer and winter breaks, minus recreation leave of 4 weeks per year

For how long and at what time within the enrolment the actual period of leave is to be taken needs to be negotiated with a student's supervisor.

The thesis will be due for submission at the end of the formal examination period of the final semester of research project enrolment (usually fourth semester) if an earlier date is not specified.

Students may enrol in a combination of research project subjects and coursework subjects as long as once the Research Project is commenced, the consecutive enrolment requirement is met and to ensure they have completed a total of 75 points for the research project by the end of their course.

You should consult your supervisor to discuss an appropriate study plan prior to enrolling in your subjects. In particular, it is important that you agree an appropriate combination of research project points and coursework point enrolment each semester.

Students will first enrol in Computer Science Research Project Pt 1, and then progress through to Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4. Students may only progress through Computer Science Research Project subjects upon successful completion of the earlier project component.
